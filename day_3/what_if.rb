# Study Drills

# 1. The If Statement tells our script that if the code below is true - run it, otherwise do not run it.

# 2. It helps keep the code organized and lets programmers know its part of the same code block.

# 3. Ruby will not know where your block ends and will throw an error.

# 4. Yes

# 5. Changing the initial values will give different responses when you run the script.
