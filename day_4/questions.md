## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  The purpose of a method is to create reusable code that we can invoke throughout our scripts to prevent having to retype the same thing over and over.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  def hello

    puts "Sam I am"

  end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  def hello_someone(name)

    puts "#{name} I am"

  end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  hello_someone("Scott")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

  They seem straight forward as of now, but I'm sure more questions will come up as we go.
